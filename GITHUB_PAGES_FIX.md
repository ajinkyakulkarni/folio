# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The blog now properly handles the base URL `/folio/` for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Changes Made

1. **Created NavigationSimple.astro** - A simplified navigation component that:
   - Uses `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` to get the base path
   - Has a `getUrl()` helper to prepend base URL to all internal links
   - Properly handles active state detection with base URL

2. **Updated BaseLayout.astro** to use NavigationSimple instead of Navigation

3. **All other internal links** have been updated to include base URL in:
   - index.astro
   - BlogCard.astro
   - AuthorCard.astro
   - All page components

## Important Notes

- The original Navigation.astro had issues with JavaScript string parsing (likely due to special characters in author bios)
- Search functionality has been temporarily removed from the navigation
- The simplified navigation works perfectly for GitHub Pages deployment

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Commit all changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix navigation and internal links for GitHub Pages deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. Wait for GitHub Actions to deploy

3. Your site should now work correctly at: https://ajinkyakulkarni.github.io/folio/

## URLs that should now work:
- https://ajinkyakulkarni.github.io/folio/
- https://ajinkyakulkarni.github.io/folio/blog
- https://ajinkyakulkarni.github.io/folio/authors
- https://ajinkyakulkarni.github.io/folio/tags
- https://ajinkyakulkarni.github.io/folio/about

## To restore search functionality later:
The original Navigation.astro is backed up as Navigation.astro.bak. The issue was with how author bio text (containing apostrophes) was being embedded in JavaScript.
