# About Me

I'm an AI researcher and engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems that make a positive impact. My journey in machine learning began during my undergraduate studies when I realized the transformative potential of AI.

## Research Interests

My primary research interests lie in:

- **Large Language Models**: Exploring efficient training methods and practical applications
- **Computer Vision**: Building robust visual recognition systems
- **Explainable AI**: Making ML models more interpretable and trustworthy
- **Edge AI**: Deploying intelligent systems on resource-constrained devices

## Teaching & Mentorship

Beyond research, I'm committed to education and mentorship. I regularly:
- Conduct workshops on practical machine learning
- Mentor junior engineers and students
- Contribute to open-source ML projects
- Write technical blogs to demystify complex AI concepts

## Philosophy

I believe AI should be accessible to everyone, not just tech giants. That's why I focus on creating practical tutorials, open-source tools, and clear explanations of complex concepts.
