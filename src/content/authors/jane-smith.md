# About Me

I'm a passionate full-stack developer who loves building products that make a difference. With over 5 years of experience in the tech industry, I've worked on everything from small startups to large-scale enterprise applications.

## My Journey

My journey into tech started during my college years at Stanford, where I discovered my love for problem-solving through code. Since then, I've been on an exciting adventure, constantly learning and growing.

## What I Do

Currently, I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp, where I lead the development of our microservices architecture. I'm particularly interested in:

- Building scalable web applications
- Cloud-native architectures
- Developer experience and tooling
- Mentoring and knowledge sharing

## Outside of Work

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking in the Bay Area, experimenting with new coffee brewing methods, or contributing to open-source projects. I believe in giving back to the community that has given me so much.
