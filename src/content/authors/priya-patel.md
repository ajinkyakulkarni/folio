# About Me

I'm a mobile developer passionate about creating delightful app experiences that work seamlessly across platforms. My journey began with native development, but I fell in love with Flutter's promise of beautiful, performant apps from a single codebase.

## Mobile Development Philosophy

### User-Centric Design
Every line of code I write is in service of the end user. Performance, accessibility, and intuitive design are my north stars.

### Cross-Platform Excellence
I believe in writing once and delivering excellence everywhere, without compromising on platform-specific experiences.

### Continuous Learning
The mobile landscape evolves rapidly. I stay current with the latest patterns, tools, and best practices.

## Technical Interests

- **State Management**: Exploring efficient patterns for complex app states
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Building apps that work seamlessly without connectivity
- **Animation & Micro-interactions**: Creating delightful UI movements that enhance UX
- **Mobile DevOps**: Streamlining build, test, and deployment pipelines

## Community Contributions

I'm committed to growing the mobile development community through:
- Organizing Flutter meetups in Toronto
- Creating beginner-friendly tutorials and courses
- Contributing to open-source Flutter packages
- Mentoring aspiring mobile developers

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Sketching UI concepts
- Exploring new app ideas
- Teaching mobile development workshops
- Advocating for diversity in tech
