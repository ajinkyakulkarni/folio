# About Me

I'm a frontend architect who believes that great user experiences come from the intersection of beautiful design and solid engineering. With a background in both computer science and design, I bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionality.

## Design Philosophy

My approach to frontend development is guided by three principles:

1. **Performance is a Feature**: Every millisecond counts in user experience
2. **Accessibility is Non-negotiable**: The web should work for everyone
3. **Simplicity Scales**: Clean code and design patterns lead to maintainable systems

## Areas of Expertise

### Design Systems
Building scalable component libraries that maintain consistency across large applications while allowing for creative flexibility.

### Performance Optimization
From bundle splitting to lazy loading, I'm obsessed with making web applications lightning fast.

### Creative Coding
Exploring the artistic side of web development with WebGL, Canvas animations, and interactive experiences.

## Current Explorations

- Web Components and the future of framework-agnostic UI
- AI-assisted design tools and their impact on workflows
- The intersection of AR/VR and web technologies
- Sustainable web design practices

## Speaking & Writing

I regularly share knowledge through:
- Conference talks on frontend architecture
- Workshops on modern CSS and animation
- Open-source contributions and tutorials
- Mentoring designers learning to code
